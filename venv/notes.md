Need to differentiate between out of frame and off ice. 
    Set an inner box for objects when looking from above. If they are in frame but out of box use different
    method to watch. ie if were getting closer to visible area we're good. Or farther away probably need to drop item
Power plays are going to suck 


LOOK AT BLOB FROM IMAGE 

Need to make object location be a reference of ice location. Need to model ice and overlay? 
    Need a way to draw on image and get vector data out of that to draw screen

Need to train on body position - shooting/standing/skating/stopping/ 
    Have nests?
